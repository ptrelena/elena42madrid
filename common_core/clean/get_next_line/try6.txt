And they were singin': Bye bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey'n rye
Singin': This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

They were singin': Bye bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey'n rye
